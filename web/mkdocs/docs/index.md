Android SMS Gateway turns your Android smartphone into an SMS gateway. It's a lightweight application that allows you to send SMS messages programmatically via an API. This makes it ideal for integrating SMS functionality into your own applications or services.

## Features

- **No registration required:** No registration or email is required to create an account. In local mode, you don't need an account at all!
- **Send SMS via API:** Use our API to send messages directly from your applications or services.
- **Support for Android 5.0 and above:** The application is compatible with Android 5.0 and later versions.
- **Message status tracking:** Monitor the status of sent messages in real-time.
- **Automatic startup:** The application starts running as soon as your device boots up.
- **Support for multiple SIM cards:** The application supports devices with multiple SIM cards.
- **Multipart messages:** The application supports sending long messages with auto-partitioning.
- **End-to-end encryption:** The application provides end-to-end encryption by encrypting message content and recipients' phone numbers before sending them to the API and decrypting them on the device.
- **Message expiration:** The application allows setting an expiration time for messages. Messages will not be sent if they have expired.
- **Random delay between messages:** Introduces a random delay between sending messages to avoid mobile operator restrictions.
- **Private server support:** The application allows for the use of a backend server in the user's infrastructure for enhanced security.
