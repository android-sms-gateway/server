The Android SMS Gateway is open-source software and free to use. We provide three server options for message sending:

- **Local Server**: The local server option allows you to send messages for free, with no restrictions or limitations.

- **Cloud Server**: The cloud server offers message sending capabilities that may be subject to certain limits. Should you plan to dispatch over 100 messages daily via the cloud server, please reach out to us for detailed information and potential arrangements.

- **Private Server**: Opting for a self-hosted private server provides unlimited message sending. However, as push notifications are relayed through the cloud server, a rate limit is imposed on our end. It might become necessary to adjust the notification debounce period in the private server's configuration settings.
